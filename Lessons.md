Lessons

Marking
-------

* `AUTOMATIC` users can mark the lesson as complete themselves
* `GRADED` multiple-choice quiz
* `TUTOR` manually marked by the tutor

Pass mark
---------

This is the required grade a user must reach in order to complete a lesson. This is the percentage required for `GRADED` lessons. `AUTOMATIC` lessons are automatically scored at 100 for the user.

If a lesson is optional and should not be included in the course progress percentage, set the `passMark` to 0.
